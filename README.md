# Discord Audio Example.
An example bot using Discord NAudio

"How do I audio" gets asked way too frequently.  This is an extremely basic bot showing you how to do it.

Note: You can just use the Program.cs code in your own bot,  but YOU DO NEED libsodium.dll AND opus.dll.
```xl
YOU NEED THESE:
*** LIBSODIUM.DLL
*** OPUS.DLL
```

#If you're having any issues compiling this:
I made this on Visual Studio 2015 (Community) (Update 3).  
.NET Framework 4.5.2
